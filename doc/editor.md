# how it works:
 the editor works like that:
 - each comment will be shown to the screen.
 - each awnser will be show bellow the comment, so the player can click on it and awnser the prompt.
 - ID connection is the "history branch" meaning, how it will travel around, to make a branch separate from the main history you must fill both comments in the new "history brench", also ID connection must allways be unique per ID order! (or the game will choose randomly one)
 - ID order is the order of the branches.

# examples:
 ![image](/doc/ex1.png)
 this screenshot is the same as: "choose a" prompt with a or b as imput, then showing the right or wrong awnser branch, and continuing the history.

# commands:
 use middle mouse button to rover the whole blueprint, and use right click to show the menu to add new frames or save/load the scene and delete frames (if clicked over then)
