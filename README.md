# easynovel
 a simple novel maker with txt and images
 
 it will make you a easy and executable visual novel :)

 how it works:
 
 - first interaction will be given as 1.1, being the first number, the comment, and the second the awnser.
 - to make a non neutral awnser (something who will inpact at the history), you need to label it as:
 - (x,y,z)2.1 being, x,y,z, given awnsers, and 2 the second comment and 1 the awnser.
 - to make an ending, it will be registered as a awnser, but you will use it as a button to go back, like a "go back", "main menu", "end." or any other word you wold like to, but it need to be awnser "0". for example, 10.0 being 10 the point of history and 0 meaning the end.
    - for better explaination i will add tutorials on given files (editor and user), with gifs or videos as example.
